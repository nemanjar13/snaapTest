TERMS AND CONDITIONS GENERAL User agrees: a) The SNAAP RFID Fob or Card is the property of TPT Technologies, Inc. and shall be returned. b) To proactively maintain a positive SNAAP Account balance. c) That failure to maintain a positive SNAAP Account balance will result in denied access to the SNAAP system, administrative fees, account closure and/or a court summons depending on the circumstances. e) To provide and maintain an up-to-date email address and or cell phone number in order to receive electronic notifications of account updates. f) To promptly provide updated payment information for auto-replenish accounts when credit card numbers, expiration dates or bank account details change. g) That the SNAAP Service Center shall have no obligation or liability to the User with respect to use or performance of the Rider Account. User agrees to indemnify and hold the SNAAP Service Center, the State of Operations, and all other operating agencies, their agents, representatives and respective employees harmless from and against any and all damage, loss, cost, expense, injury or liability relating to, arising from, or as a result of the use of, or the performance of the Rider Account, or as a result of inaccurate User Account information. h) To be fully responsible for any and all charges arising from the use of each Rider Account until such time as User either surrenders the SNAAP RFID Fob or Card or reports it lost/stolen to the SNAAP Service Center. j) To use the Rider Account only for the individual person to whom it was issued. Use of the Rider Account by a persona not specifically associated with that Rider Account is a violation of this Agreement, may be a violation of applicable law and may result in additional charges, including administrative fees. k) To provide the SNAAP Service Center with current, accurate and complete personal information to include, name, phone number(s), mailing address, email address, replenishment information, rider for all individuals that will use the Rider Account, and provide accurate and complete updates when information changes. l) That all Rider Accounts will be required to utilize automatic replenishment. m) Not to travel with more than one Rider in a single vehicle. PREPAID ACCOUNT User agrees to maintain a Prepaid Account with the Service Center to cover User\\u2019s applicable Ride Fees, charges and fees as described in this Agreement. Failure to maintain a positive balance shall constitute a breach of this Agreement and may subject the User to the loss of discounts, administrative costs, and termination of this agreement. User agrees that it is their responsibility to monitor their usage and account balance.

Any User of Flex Rider Accounts agrees: a) To only operate the HOV switch when it is safe to do so. b) That the use of the Rider Account in HOV mode with less than the required number of people in the vehicle where an HOV discount is available is a misuse of the Rider Account.

Improper HOV declaration is also subject to roadside legal enforcement which can result in administrative fees, court penalties and fines. c) The Flex will function as a standard Rider Account regardless of switch position on Toll Facilities which do not support the Flex functionality. d) Flex Rider Account users who do not use their Flex functionality for HOV discounted transactions on Virginia Express Lanes are urged to exchange the Flex Rider Account for a standard Rider Account (at no cost).

The initial Replenishment Threshold should be based on at least three days of anticipated usage. The Service Center reserves the right to increase the Replenishment Threshold based on User\\u2019s usage patterns to aid in the maintenance of the Account(s).

The Replenishment Amount will be either the average monthly usage or $35.00 per Rider Account, whichever is greater.

If a credit/debit card or automatic checking account debit is declined more than once, User may become ineligible for automatic replenishment. b) Manual Account replenishment: User should replenish their Account once it reaches Low Balance in order to maintain a positive balance and avoid interruption in service.

The fee will be waived if the User provides a copy of an official police report indicating that the Rider Account was stolen. DAMAGED Rider Account The SNAAP is the property of VDOT. Any Rider Account that has been altered, defaced or damaged in any manner will result in a fee of $10.00 for each Standard Rider Account and $20.00 for each Flex Rider Account.

Upon termination of this Agreement, the account will be closed and the User must promptly return all Rider Account(s) in original condition, less normal wear to the SNAAP Service Center. Users failing to return Rider Account shall be assessed lost/stolen fees. A refund will be processed within 30 days for any balance remaining in the User\\u2019s SNAAP Account, less any amounts owed under this Agreement.

An SNAAP User expressly understands and agrees that the SNAAP Service Center shall not be liable to an SNAAP User for any damages resulting from these actions.

The fee will be waived if the User provides a copy of an official police report indicating that the Rider Account was stolen.\n\n                DAMAGED Rider Account\n\n                The SNAAP is the property of VDOT. Any Rider Account that has been altered, defaced or damaged in any manner will result in a fee of $10.00 for each Standard Rider Account and $20.00 for each Flex Rider Account.\n\n                ACCOUNT TERMINATION\n\n                The SNAAP Service Center or SNAAP User may terminate this Agreement at any time. Upon termination of this Agreement, the account will be closed and the User must promptly return all Rider Account(s) in original condition, less normal wear to the SNAAP Service Center. Users failing to return Rider Account shall be assessed lost/stolen fees. A refund will be processed within 30 days for any balance remaining in the User’s SNAAP Account, less any amounts owed under this Agreement. If the User’s account balance is insufficient to cover charges, the User will be liable for all such amounts, and may become liable for additional service charges, fines, or penalties in accordance with applicable law if such unpaid charges are not promptly paid. Any unresolved negative balance shall be subject to further collection procedures and/or legal action.\n\n                Any unclaimed positive balances will be treated as unclaimed property in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n\n                PRIVACY POLICY\n\n                It shall be the policy that VDOT shall only collect and retain SNAAP User information that is absolutely necessary and essential in order to properly conduct and record SNAAP financial transactions. Information collected by VDOT relative to individual SNAAP customer usage shall only be released:\n\n                a) In response to a bona fide court order/subpoena for information;\n\n                b) At the request of the individual SNAAP Account owner(s); or\n\n                c) To collect unpaid tolls or negative Account balance.\n\n                VDOT may provide SNAAP User usage data in summary form to assist in transportation research. However, under no circumstance will individual customer information be disclosed to any nonaffiliated third parties for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing, or other marketing through electronic mail to customers. VDOT is subject to federal and state statutory requirements and may amend its SNAAP privacy policy at any time without notice in accordance with applicable statutory requirements.\n\n                OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n                It is expressly understood and agreed that an SNAAP User authorizes the SNAAP Service Center to access User’s credit card, debit card or ACH and make charges authorized under this Agreement. An SNAAP User expressly understands and agrees that the SNAAP Service Center shall not be liable to an SNAAP User for any damages resulting from these actions. Additionally, the SNAAP Service Center shall not be liable for:\n\n                a) Any incidental, indirect, special or consequential damages, including but not limited to, loss of use, revenues, profits or savings, even if the SNAAP Service Center knew or should have known of the possibility of such damages; or\n\n                b) Claims, demands, or actions against an SNAAP User by any person, corporation, or other legal entity resulting from the use of the Rider Accounts, credit report inquiry, check authorization and/or charging of the SNAAP User’s credit card, debit or check card. SNAAP Users who elect to provide funds via automatic draft drawn directly against account deposits agree to be responsible for the adequacy of those funds to satisfy all amounts drawn against them.\n\n                The SNAAP Service Center may change the terms of this Agreement at any time by providing electronic or written notice to the SNAAP User. If the SNAAP is used after an SNAAP User receives notice of the new terms of this Agreement, then the SNAAP User shall be bound by the new SNAAP terms. For purposes of this Agreement, the SNAAP User shall be deemed to have received notice 10 days after the notification of changes is either emailed or deposited with the United States Postal Service, postage prepaid, addressed to the SNAAP User at the most recent address registered on the SNAAP User’s Account record at the SNAAP Service Center.\n\n                The captions used in this Agreement have been inserted for convenience and for reference only and shall not be deemed to limit or define the text of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any provision or part of this Agreement or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall ever be held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unconstitutional for any reason, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision or part of this Agreement to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected. For the purpose of giving any and all notice(s) to the SNAAP Service Center required under the provisions of this Agreement, User shall use the following mailing address:\n\n                SNAAP Customer Service Center\n                4295 Cromwell Road, Suite 206\n                Chattanooga, TN 37421\n                Effective July 1, 2022\n\n                𑂽Yes, I have read the SNAAP Customer Agreement and accept its terms and conditions.
